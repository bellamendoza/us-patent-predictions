# U.S. Patent Citations Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes U.S. patent data to compare citation patterns of federally funded and non-federally funded patents. 

Citations serve as a key indicator of a patentâ€™s impact and influence on future innovations, making them a useful measure for comparison. This analysis examines whether federally funded patents receive more, fewer, or different types of citations compared to those developed without government support.

## Key Questions
1. Do federally funded patents receive more citations than non-federally funded patents?
2. Are there citation differences in the technological focus of federally funded and non-federally funded patents, as indicated by CPC (Cooperative Patent Classification) codes?

## Data

For this project, I use [USPTO's PatentView data](https://patentsview.org/), including the following tables:
- _g_application_
- _g_cpc_current_
- _g_cpc_title_
- _g_gov_interest_org_
- _g_us_patent_citation_

## Methods
For this project, I use machine learning, including the following models:
- model 1
- model 2
- model 3
